Lc0 (Leela Chess Zero) is a chess engine that uses a trained neural network to play chess. It was inspired by Google's Alpha Zero project and Lc0's current networks have since surpassed Alpha Zero's strength.

# Lc0 comes in two parts:

1. **The Lc0 Engine** (also called **"the binary"**)
2. **A Neural Network** (also called **"the net"**)

The **Lc0 engine** sees the board and makes the moves, and the **neural net** tells the engine which moves are good. _Lc0 is only as good as the network that it uses._

***You will need to download BOTH parts if you want to use Lc0.*** 

Go to [Download](https://lczero.org/play/download/) to get the engine and find a network.

Lc0 runs best with a powerful GPU, unlike other traditional engines that run on CPU, so keep that in mind. 

It is also best if you get a chess GUI, so that you can see the board and the suggestions that Leela is making. A great GUI designed specifically for Lc0 is [Nibbler](https://github.com/fohristiwhirl/nibbler).
