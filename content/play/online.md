The easiest way to play Lc0 if you don't want to [install it on your computer]({{<ref "quickstart">}}) is to use one of **Lichess** bots. You can find them in the respective <a><href="https://lichess.org/team/all-the-leelas">lichess team</a>. The ones that are almost always online are <a href="https://lichess.org/@/Lc0Test">Lc0Test</a>, <a href="https://lichess.org/@/leela2200">leela2200</a> or <a href="https://lichess.org/@/MiniHuman">MiniHuman</a>. There is also an official Leela bot called <a href="https://lichess.org/@/LeelaChess">LeelaChess</a>, but most of the time it's not online.
